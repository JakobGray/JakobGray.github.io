# Personal Website

This is the start of a website I hope to slowly build over time. It's not much now but I plan to work on it here and there to actually turn it into something.
View the website [here](https://jakobgray.github.io/)
## Contents (eventually)
- Current or completed mini projects
- About me page
- Resume
- Likely another page or two of stuff
